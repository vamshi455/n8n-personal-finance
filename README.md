# Personal Finance Agent - A Smart Money Helper

## What is this?

This is a computer program that helps you understand your money! It's like having a super smart robot friend that can look at your bank statements and tell you where your money goes.

## What does it do?

- **Reads your bank files**: You give it an Excel file with your spending, and it reads every line
- **Sorts your spending**: It puts your purchases into groups like "food", "gas", "fun stuff"
- **Talks to you**: You can ask it questions like "How much did I spend on pizza this month?"
- **Predicts the future**: It can guess how much you might spend next month
- **Gives advice**: It suggests ways to save money

## How does it work?

Think of it like this:
1. You upload a file with all your purchases (like a digital receipt book)
2. The AI robot looks at each purchase and says "This is food" or "This is for your car"
3. You can ask questions and it gives you answers
4. It shows you pretty charts and graphs

## Cool Features

- **Smart Brain**: Uses OpenAI (the same company that made ChatGPT) to understand your spending
- **Voice Control**: You can talk to it instead of typing
- **3D Charts**: Shows your money in cool spinning graphics
- **Learns**: Gets smarter the more you use it

## What You Need

- A computer (Mac or Windows)
- Internet connection
- Excel files from your bank
- Basic typing skills

```

## Troubleshooting (When Things Break)

**Problem**: "Port already in use"
**Fix**: Someone else is using that number, try a different one

**Problem**: "Cannot find module"
**Fix**: Install the missing pieces with `npm install`

**Problem**: "Permission denied"
**Fix**: Ask a grown-up to help with computer permissions

## Future Ideas

- Mobile app version
- Photo receipt scanning
- Automatic bank connections
- Saving goal tracking

## Made With Love

This project uses lots of cool technology:
- React (for the pretty website)
- Node.js (for the smart brain)
- OpenAI (for understanding human language)
- PostgreSQL (for remembering everything)
- TensorFlow (for predicting the future)

Remember: This is a learning project! It's okay if things break - that's how we learn to fix them!
